POI Cost-Profit Table
==================================================================

Dataset Information: 
This dataset comprises various cost-profit tables (for eight cities) that indicate the cost (based on distance) required to travel from one points-of-interest (POI) to another POI, and the resulting profit (based on popularity) gained from reaching that POI. These cost-profit tables are derived from the "Flickr User-POI Visits" dataset, i.e., the various "userVisits-{cityName}.csv" files.

File Description:
There are a total of eight files, each named "costProfCat-{cityName}POI-all.csv", where each row indicated a link from one POI to another and the associated cost (distance), profit (popularity), theme (category) and lat/lon coordinates.

The cost-profit table for each city is stored in a single csv file that contains the following columns/fields:
 - from: poiID of the starting POI.
 - to: poiID of the destination POI.
 - cost: distance (metres) between the starting POI (from) to the destination POI (to).
 - profit: popularity of the destination POI (to), based on number of POI visits
 - theme: category of the POI (e.g., Park, Museum, Cultural, etc).
