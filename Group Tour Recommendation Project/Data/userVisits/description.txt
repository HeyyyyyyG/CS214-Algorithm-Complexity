Flickr User-POI Visits
==================================================================

Dataset Information: 
This dataset comprises a set of users and their visits to various points-of-interest (POIs) in eight cities. The user-POI visits are determined based on geo-tagged YFCC100M Flickr photos that are: (i) mapped to specific POIs location and POI categories; and (ii) grouped into individual travel sequences (consecutive user-POI visits that differ by <8hrs). Other associated datasets are the "List of POIs" dataset ("POI-{cityName}.csv" files) and "POI Cost-Profit Table" dataset ("costProfCat-{cityName}POI-all.csv" files). Besides, the duration time in each POI can be inferred from the travel sequences.

All user-POI visits in each city are stored in a single csv file that contains the following columns/fields:
 - photoID: identifier of the photo based on Flickr.
 - userID: identifier of the user based on Flickr.
 - dateTaken: the date/time that the photo was taken (unix timestamp format).
 - poiID: identifier of the place-of-interest (Flickr photos are mapped to POIs based on their lat/long).
 - poiTheme: category of the POI (e.g., Park, Museum, Cultural, etc).
 - poiFreq: number of times this POI has been visited.
 - seqID: travel sequence no. (consecutive POI visits by the same user that differ by <8hrs are grouped as one travel sequence).
